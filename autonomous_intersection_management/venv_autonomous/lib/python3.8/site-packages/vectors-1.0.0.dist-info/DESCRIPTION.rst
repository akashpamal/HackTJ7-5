CHANGES
=======

0.0.9
    ``from __future__ import division`` added to fix division operator to use
    true division as in Python 3.0 instead of classic division.


Vectors
=======

Vectors is a simple library toolkit dealing with common vector and point
logic in the 3-dimensional space.

Supports commonly used vector math functions including:

- Vector magnitude
- Addition with another vector or a real number.
- Multiplication by another vector or a real number.
- Dot product
- Cross/scalar product
- Angle between vectors
- Check if two vectors are perpendicular, parallel or non-parallel

Usage
=====

There are multiple ways to create our vector instances using the vectors
module.

We can first initialize some vectors and points calling their repsective
class contructors as follows.

.. code:: python

    from vectors import Point, Vector

    v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3) #=> Vector(1, 2, 3)
  v2 = Vector(2, 4, 6) #=> Vector(2, 4, 6)

  p1 = Point(1, 2, 6) #=> Point(1, 2, 3)
  p2 = Point(2, 0, 2) #=> Point(2, 4, 6)

We can also create a Point instance or a Vector instance with a list
using the class method from\_list().

.. code:: python

    components = [1.2, 2.4, 3.8]

    v = Vector.from_list(components) #=> Vector(1.2, 2.4, 3.8)

We can also create our Vectors from two Point instances using the
classmethod from\_points().

.. code:: python

    v = Vector.from_points(p1, p2) #=> Vector(1, -2, -4)

We can also get access to the vector array to use it with other
libraries.

.. code:: python

    v1.vector #=> [1, 2, 3]

Magnitude
=========

We can get the magnitude of the vector easily.

.. code:: python

    v1.magnitude() #==> 3.7416573867739413

Addition
========

We can add a real number to a vector or compute the vector sum of two
vectors as follows.

.. code:: python

    v1.add(2) #=> Vector(3.0, 4.0, 5.0)

    v1.sum(v2) #=> Vector(3.0, 6.0, 9.0)

Both methods return a Vector instance.

Multiplication
==============

We can multiply a vector by a real number.

.. code:: python

    v1.multiply(4) #=> Vector(4.0, 8.0, 12.0)

The above returns a Vector instance.

Dot Product
===========

We can find the dot product of two vectors.

.. code:: python

    v1.dot(v2) #=> 0.0

We can also use angle theta on the dot function.

.. code:: python

    v1.dot(v2. 180)

Dot product returns a real number.

Cross/Scalar Product
====================

We can find the cross product of two vectors.

.. code:: python

    v1.cross(v2) #=> Vector(0, 0, 0)

Cross product returns a Vector instance, which is always perpendicular
to the other two vectors.

Angle Theta
===========

We can also find the angle theta between two vectors.

.. code:: python

    v1.angle(v2) #=> 0.0

Angle is a measured in degrees.

Parallel, Perpendicular, Non-Parallel
=====================================

We can check if two vectors are parallel, perpendicular or non-parallel
to each other.

.. code:: python

    v1.parallel(v2) #=> True
    v1.perpendicular(v2) #=> False
    v1.non_parallel(v2) #=> False

All of the above return either True or False.

TODO
====

- Create Analytic Geometry Toolkit based on the vectors toolkit.
